title: 6 Concepts and 4 Psychological Techniques I Use To "Process My Emotions"
image: /images/life-blog/psychology-concepts.jpg
---

I really wanted to write a series of blog posts on how I process my emotions. The problem is writing such a series is really hard given there are so many concepts.

I am no psychologist and if you are suffering from mental illness [you should approach one](/optimism/why-therapy).

At the same time, I believe you should learn the psychological concepts well cuz they give a deeper understanding of how you work and also how others work.

Below I describe a few concepts and provide a few resources. In general, learn this concept in detail from a video or blog by psychologists. A lot of these concepts were introduced to me by [my therapist](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ishita-kulkarni-520381166?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name).

The must-watch video recommendation here is the YouTube channel of [Dr. Alok Kanojia a Harvard Based Psychotherapist](https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG).

**It's possible to learn these skills and learn to be a more stable-minded and free person**. Think of this blogpost as a gateway to some of these concepts that you can put into your mental toolkit. As time goes on, adapt and develop some of your own.

## 1. **Useful Psychology Concepts**

### 1.1 **Cognitive Distortion**

#### Splitting facts from emotions

- Cognitive Distortions are biases of our brain where your brain feels your emotions are valid and tell something about the real world when in reality you don't have evidence.
- If you have lots of cognitive distortions in a fixed period, or have a high intensity of it, you are likely to get depressed.
- Cognitive distortions can be broken by asking counter questions and answering them which can lead to deeper realizations of reality.
- Some types of Cognitive Distortions are:
  - **Mind Reading**:
    - Assuming you know what is going on in someone's mind
    - For Eg: Your significant other looks angry. You know you didn't do anything such that they are angry. But you assume that they are angry because of you.
  - **Discounting the Positive**
    - If 100 things go good, and 1 things go bad. You believe everything was bad.
  - **Catastrophizing**
    - You jump to worst-case scenarios.
    - For Eg: You made a small mistake at work and felt that you'd be fired.
  - **Labeling**
- There are about 9-10 other cognitive distortions. Watch this 5-minute video to know them and how to counter them.

### 1.2 **Defense Mechanisms**

#### Brain/Ego trying to protect itself

- Defense Mechanisms are the brain's way of trying to protect itself in an unhealthy way.
- Some types of Defense Mechanisms are:
  - **Sublimation**
    - Eg: Consciously or unconsciously
  - Projection
    - Eg: You make others panic when you are in panic.
- A part of healing emotionally is to learn to come across a similar situation and now have your defense mechanisms fired up.
- It can be helpful to know these as they can help you identify behaviors in yourself.

### 1.3 **Cognitive Dissonance**

#### State where the brain cannot make sense of two counter truths

- The brain has a nature of making sense of things around us. But sometimes if the evidence presented by the brain is too counter to its belief it can cause a kind of split in the brain which can be a really painful experience.
- If you have enough splits (i.e. your brain is fractured into multiple parts), you won't be able to think thoughts clearly, and this would likely have led to some kind of trauma.
For example, assume you had a 10-year friendship but your friend suddenly turned #toxic.
  - The picture you had in your mind was of a really good friendship and a deep vulnerable connection. But now they say they have always hated you and everything you do. And they say 2 or three more mean things.
  - This can make you start questioning not just one moment but the entire last 10 years.
  - This will be too hard for you to think about so, your brain activates a defense mechanism and makes you not think about it.
- The way to get over cognitive distortions is to synchronize the truths by creating a sort of sentence something that balances both sides and connects some way.

> I and my friend had a good connect till now. But it seems they are not enjoying anymore and want space. They do say they didn't enjoy the connection till now but that is something I'll have to contemplate on. For now, I can let them be.

### 1.4 **Coping Mechanisms**

#### Your toolbox for processing emotions

- Coping mechanisms are ways to deal with emotional troubles.
- Coping mechanisms can be
  - Adaptive (helpful)
    - Example: Exercise.
  - Maladaptive (not helpful)
    - Eg: Alchohol. Or even Excessive Exercise.
- They can be categorized into 5 parts
  - **Emotional**
    - Trying to work on the emotions.
    - Eg:
      - Crying
      - Journalling
      - etc
  - **Problem solving**
    - Solve the problem that's troubling you.
    - This does not work when the problem is not under your control. Using this if the problem is not under your control will backfire.
  - **Meaning based**
    - You try to find a value-based meaning behind what happened.
    - This is useful when the problem is not under your control.
  - **Social**
    - Seeking out to others to help process.
    - Eg: Talking to a friend
  - **Avoidance**
    - Avoiding the problem.
    - Eg:
      - Exercise Alchohol
- Recommendations
  - You need to discover coping mechanisms that work for you.
  - Read about different adaptive (helpful) and nonadaptive (not helpful) coping mechanisms here.
  - Read this list of coping mechanisms choose a few and practice. See what works.

### 1.5 **Fight Flight Freeze Fawn**

- Apart from Defense Mechanisms there are common responses when we are threatened.
- Our brain assumes we are around a physical danger and can respond with one of these:
- **Fight**:
  - Blood supply shifts from the brain and digestion to the legs and heart making heart rate increase.
  - Body is ready to fight.
- **Flight**
  - Same physical sensation as fight by body is ready to run away physically.
- **Freeze**
  - Brain and body freeze. You don't know what to do next.
- **Fawn**
  - When dealing with a person who makes us treated, the brain people pleases/agrees to whatever the other person says because it feels it's a real threat.
  - This can cause someone to stay in a toxic relationship.

### 1.6 **Trauma**: Most Important Topic

#### Body/Mind acts like it's under stress based on something that happened a long time ago which isn't present now

- Trauma can be harder to identify. It's the great chameleon of mental illness because it can manifest as many things.

1. **Chronic Depression:** Someone depressed their whole life.
2. **Impulsivity** or Lack of unifying direction.
3. **Vulnerability to repeated mistakes**. Making the same damn mistake over and over again.
4. **In-ability to take risks**.
5. **Being a people pleaser**. I don’t know how to stop.
6. **Paralysis of initiation**. We can’t bring ourselves to start stuff.
7. **Can’t moderate relationships**. Can’t engage in moderate relationships.
8. **Sematic Problems**: Problems with your body that aren’t medically diagnostical.

- We all have some trauma big or small.
- There are many many methods to deal with trauma. I recommend watching the video first.

After watching  [read my notes](/life-blog/deep-dive-trauma) for revision.

There is also something called as **Generational Trauma** which is something passed on from family members to younger children. For this I would recommend watching [Dr. Ramini's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DoctorRamani).

An aspect of trauma which doesn't get talked about often is experiencing malevolence in the world. I believe [Jordan Peterson does explain it much better](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jordan+peterson+trauma)

## 2. **Useful Psychology Tools**

### 2.1 **Emotion Trackers**

- This will help you identify emotions better
- It's a diagram that can help you identify your emotions.
- This is useful to know as a concept even if you don't use it regularly.
- Recommended blog

I also used to use [How we feel](https://howwefeel.org/) app which helped me developed deep emotional awareness.

### 2.2 **RAIN method for Radical Acceptance**

- Radical Acceptance is acceptance of emotions and allowing ourselves to feel the emotion without judgment.
- This can teach our body to be okay with emotions and that feeling bad is okay.
- This I believe is the first step to processing emotions.
- I don't use the acronyms mentally but it can be useful to understand.
  - Recognize
  - Allow it to be as it is
  - Investigate with care
  - Nurture with self-compassion

### 2.3 **EFT**: Emotional Freedom Technique

- EFT/Tapping is tapping at a specific part of your body like your forehead.
- If there
- Recommended video

### 2.4 **Journaling** your emotions

- Typing or writing down how you are feeling can help you get over your cognitive dissonance and emotional troubles much faster.

## 3. Schools/Modules of Psychology

Psychology is mostly divided into modules. And it can be interesting to look at different models to increase your knowledge futher.

**The truth is I haven't looked deep enough**. I know things on the surface of these modules. And it has been so long that I have forgotten most of it. I'll visit them if and when need arises. What I would recommended is just search bout these concepts on YouTube and gain a general understanding of it.

Each module introduces a varity of techniques.

I have touched upon two schools during my theraphy sessions.

### 3.1 Cognitive Behavioral Theraphy (CBT)

CBT is based on a premis that emotions are connected to behavior and thoughts and influencing one of those can impact the other.

[Image Source](https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-therapy.html)

For me, knowing that thoughts, behavior and emotions are interconnected helps.

- Sometimes trying to process emotion doesn't work because the underlying belief is the cause of the problem. At that time, cognitive reframe has helped me.
- Similarly specially with anxiety, changing behaviors such as decided not to take a decision late at nights or when I am sleepy has really helped.

### 3.2 Dialectic Behaviour Theraphy (DBT)

The `Radical Acceptance` tool that I have talked about earlier comes from the distress chapter of DBT.

DBT has a whole module called Distress Tolerance that can help is managing emotions.

## 4. How I typically process emotions (mainly trauma)

I combine a lot of tools and techniques mentioned above. When I was learning the techniques I used to do it consciously. Now it's much more automatic.

I always observe my mind and body to how it's feeling.

TODO: mention that in initial days you needed to look at emotion wheel or use the How we feel app.

1. If I think I have a cognitive distortion cuz as catastrophizing I'll ask myself counter questions.
2. If I think I am having some kind of dissonance, I'll try to think through and cover the range of thought.
3. If I have a lot of older sadder memories or trauma. If I observe myself skipping time. Or suddenly crying.

- I'll assume it's some trauma or sadness. I try to feel my body (i.e. a form of RAIN method)
- If needed I'll follow it up with journaling.
- I'll try to get everything out on the journal page.
- I use a digital journal and I take a pause and write in that moment.
- Typically in a day or two I'll be fully fine not even recalling what was making me sad. Or if I do recall, that even will be `desensitized`.
- Initially, I only journaled about my feelings and events. Now, I mostly combine with cognitive reframe at the end. (cognitive reframing is a kind of thought-based coping mechanism.)

4. In case I am not able to think through the sadness,

- I'll use EFT which can help me think clearly.

5. If I am not able to be in control which used to happen when I was in deep depression,
1. I'll try to consciously distract myself for a little bit a few hours (i.e. avoidance-based) but in a day or two automatically revisit and try to process with one of the ways

Mention TODO: I also used to use [How we feel](https://howwefeel.org/) app which helped me developed deep emotional awareness.

## 5. My progress

- Initially, when I had depression I used to do these for multiple hours a day. I would even reach out to friends.
- Once all the **major** things were resolved, I found there was nothing to process. So, I happened to take a few months break.
- Then a few **medium** things appeared. Which I processed.
- Later some really tiny things.
- And now almost **negligible** things.
  - I still do the process. I don't want backlog to grow and I would like to always have my mental clarity.
  - Though mostly I don't need to do journal or EFT.
  - I am in touch with my body and mind all the time and can detect any disturbance ASAP and do a quick RAIN or cognitive reframe.

## 6. Ending: What to do next?

Above I have described different concepts that I believe people should know and I have provided the resources I used.

As a next step, I suggest,

**#1. Be curious**

Whatever you are struggling with search YouTube for it. My only suggestion would be to listen to psychologists.

Also, a good mental model is: **If you know about a problem and solution for multiple years but haven't fixed the problem, then you likely don't know the problem or the solution**. You need to seek to understand the problem from a completely new POV that you don't know and try out a solution that you don't know.

In the past, I have searched for

- How to deal with Trauma
- How to process emotions
- How to empathize with others
- Having trouble sleeping psychology.
- etc

**Some of my recommended resources are:**

- [Alok Kanojia, MD.](https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG/videos)
- [Dr Ramini](https://www.youtube.com/@DoctorRamani): Mainly focused on narcisistic relationship.
- [Julia Kristina](https://www.youtube.com/@juliakristinamah)
- [Theraphy in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/@TherapyinaNutshell)
- [Kati Morton](https://www.youtube.com/@Katimorton)
- [Andrew Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab/videos)

**#2. Start processing your emotions anyways. Just aim towards inbox zero**

It's possible. I am on the path of it. Deal with every psychological problem you have fully.

And have no new backlog. It's one thing to have problems from the past. But it's really unproductive to not process new things as they come because they'll fill up your backlog.

I hope this blog post served you and gave you my perspective on the insights I have learned. I am grateful for many of my friends,  [my therapist](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ishita-kulkarni-520381166?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name), and many many internet resources especially Dr. Kanoj and Dr. Ramini who supported me during my difficult times. No amount of thanks is going to cut it. 🙂

This blog post doesn't cover the topic of thinking rational thoughts cognitive reframing and spirituality. Cognitive reframing can cement your emotional healing and make it complete. And seeking and understanding spiritual concepts from Shreemad Bhagwad Gita has been my main gateway for a lot of cognitive regrame. I'll be writing a blog post on it soon. (TODO)

From whatever you are going through. May you find the strength and techniques that can help you navigate this mental terrain! Wishing you all the best!

**Question: What was your adaptive (helpful) and maladaptive (not-helpful) coping mechanisms?** Do let me know!
