This blogpost is currently being written.

***

Trello is the application that I use to organize my life. I have been using it for over 1.5 years and for the last 1 year my use as increases substantiously.

If you have met me, you know how much organized and systematized I am. A big part of it is systems thinking which I must have first learnt in Atomic Habits or YouTube. A big part of my life system is Trello.

Over the months I have gone through many iterations. And this post aims to explain my steps. I have also helped create board for my friends and family.

By end of the post, you‚Äôd have created a perfect Kanban Trello board that will significantly improve your productivity.

While I do use Kanban at work, this post is mostly going to target personal productivity, though the principles won‚Äôt change much when working in a team.

As I explain the steps I‚Äôll illustrate reasoning and process.

I use Trello for:

- Prioritizing what to do.
- Capturing notes.
- To be on top of things.

There are many principles related to systems and systems thinking that I follow which I'll describe in a separate blogpost. (TODO).

This blogpost will give a brief of what Trello is and what subsystems I have created.

## Before you read further: How to implement this post?

NOTE: You may not use every subsystems I create. The subsystem can make Trello complicated initially. Only use a subsystem when you feel your progress is stuck and you aren't able to get more out of Trello.

Start by reading the description, setting up a Trello account and start using it daily. As you use it, you'll eventually find roadblocks/things that can be improved. Improve them.

And while using it, keep a look at this post so that it can help you optimize even further.

Again, you don't need to implement everything. #implementWhatResonates.

> Keep things as simple as possible!

## What is Trello? Why do I use it? And Principle

Trello is a simple Kanban tool I use to organize my life. Tasks are organized into cards and columns are like production pipeline.

We take a task and move it forward through the column till done.

If you are new to Trello and Kanban, watch the video below. (2x speed recommended)

<iframe class="aspect-video w-full" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3F3l3psqXY?si=JRes4P_YLCh6f7K1&amp;start=12" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Trello is based on Kanban Principles.

Kanban is based on vehicle production pipeline. Imagine you are a car production pipeline at once stage you have assembly, one stage painting, one stage electronics, etc. Things move from one stage another.

If you have multiple cars waiting in a stage, that means it‚Äôs something can be improved there.

It‚Äôs similar with a Kanban board. Kanban is a visual way of seeing work. Tasks are represented by cards and different stages are represented by column. At it‚Äôs basic there are 3 columns: Todo, Doing and Done.

But like a well defined car production line, we can create our own stages.

For example, suppose you are a content creator, for you the stages can look like

- Ideas
- Research
- Content Creation
- Editing
- Promotion
- Done

Now, everyone works from the tasks in the board and everyone can view the board to gauge the progress of work.

For example, suppose you and 5 other collegues are working on the board. A card would be assigned to each. This card would include: Task, Details, Files, Images, Checklists, etc.

As a person is working on a card, they can work on it and move it to appropriate lane. For example, a content creator creates content, moves the card to Editing lane, a editor can pick the task, edit the content, send to promotion column, social media manager can pick card from promotion column and promote.

This way everything goes from one column stage to another and everyone knows where the card is.

So given this basic knowledge, we‚Äôll start creation of our first board.

## Action 1: Basic Setup

Steps,

1. Sign-Up to Trello
2. Create a blank board.
3. Add 3 Columns
4. Todo, Doing and Done.
5. And you have your first Trello board ready to work on.

Add a card to the board. You can drag a card from one column to the next until done.

## What Boards do I have?

Here are a few of the boards I have created.

## What Trello Sub-Systems I have created to get most out of Trello?

While the basic, Todo, Doing and Done column is good. The problem is of scale [TODO: Link to post on systems here]. As a system gets more efficient, we are able to get more task done until the system chokes up again and we need to optimize.

Therefore, we need to iterate over our system so that it can scale our current needs. While many of the systems are great, note our main aim is high output and not high documentation. So, if productivity can happen in other ways, that's preferrable too. (TODO: Link to my blogpost on Challenge and Systems related to it)

Below are a few systems I use. Some of which I have created myself. Each of this is to help me get more clarity.

> Clarity precedes completing the responsibility

### Clarity of what to do within the task: Card Breakdown

If you have a big task, you want to be able to break down it into smaller achievable tasks.

For example, launching a new website involves

- learning about how to launch
- signing up for a service
- defining the content
- writing the content
- etc.

A big step is comprised of many smaller steps.

By breaking down a card well, you'll find you are able to do the task better. You are able to understand it in clarity.

There are a few ways to break a task in Trello.

- Into Cards
- Into Checklists

Usually, if I have a task which is multiple months, I'll break it down into a bunch of smaller cards that I can take action on in about a week.

And for checklist it depends, I may not may not use checklist if the task itself it small. But if a task get's complex, I'll break it down to checklists.

## Clarity of what to do next: Breaking down Todo column into multiple columns

Our basic column layout was todo, doing and done. As you get more productive, you'll find that there are more things to do and your todo list keeps getting bigger and bigger. This is natural because we actually have a lot of things to do in life [TODO link to blogpost].

The problem our TODO list starts getting overwhelming.

But note, as I mentioned in one of my previous blogpost, as long as we focus on what's the most important thing to do and as long as we do it well, we'll get highest amount of productivity we can get.

And we can arrange our Trello system in a way that can help with that.

Instead of a simple TODO column, I split it into multiple columns.

- This week: Includes all the tasks I am focused on this week. (I am relying on this less now. But starting out start with this and see if this is enough. Checkout the dashboard section)
- Future planning columns: Multiple columns to help me prioritize what to do next.

I keep the left section of the board focused on what I wnat to do and right section of the board for future planning and knowledge units.

Here's how I break down future planning columns. this mostly depends on the domain.

If I am creating a board for health. I'll break down todos differently. For Blogging, I'll break it down differently.

For example for blogging I have

- **Needs Organization**: Just ideas. I need to organize these better.
- **Needs Refinement**: These are developed ideas that need some refinement.
- **Ready for Production**: These are clear ideas that are ready for writing.

This way whenever I need to do a talk, I pick up from Ready to Production.

Columns in Travel board are arranged differently.

- One section which has couple of columns for World Tour
- One section for India

Tip: If you don't know your domain well yet, breakdown create MoSCoW columns: Must Do, Should Do, Can Do, Won‚Äôt Do

## Clarity of how to progress: Breaking down: In Progress Columns

I want to know the progress of my tasks my just looking at the board.

Breakdown of cards.

In Progress Columns

Completing a Task Fully: Chained Tasks

‚Äå

Many times when we do a the main task, it leads to the creation of more tasks.

‚Äå

For example, suppose you decided to pay off your loan, you went into the bank and enquirer, but the bank says you cannot close your loan at once, you can pay 25% now and after the financial year pay the rest.

‚Äå

Now you did the main task of figuring out but it lead to creation of subtasks. Only when the subtasks are complete you can say the main task is complete.

‚Äå

This os what I call a chain task ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí•.

‚Äå

A chained task for me is a task that while doing you realize there are most tasks to be done, the main task is not complete without the chained task.

‚Äå

And I feel chained task are important because you don't want to keep anything undone. You want to complete things fully!

‚Äå

One of the characteristics of Narendra Modi is he follows through until the end. He would make sure he is monitoring things fully. And that is what we need to do to, we have to make sure all tasks are done till the end.

‚Äå

Some other example of chained task:

- When writing a blogpost, I might get new ideas of other blogposts that I want to link up.

‚Äå

My chained tasks system is 3 fold:

- Chained Column on the board

- A checklist for Chained

- While doing a task, I'll keep adding chained tasks.

- Chained Label

Quality Control

Freeze Mode/Automatic

Learning from the Tasks: Debrief Column and Debrief Task

What tasks to pick?

What task to pick? The task which eliminates need for other tasks.

‚Äå

I try to pick tasks that are the most urgent üö® and important first. Then I'll pick a few non-urgent and important tasks.

‚Äå

Initially, I spent a lot of time picking mostly urgent tasks& important. Now it's mostly non-urgent and important.

‚Äå

Non-urgent important tasks are long term tasks. Things like Reading a Book. Implementing a new technique. Setting up my Financial Flywheel. Etc.

‚Äå

If I do these properly, these will free up more time in the future and eliminate all the other tasks.

‚Äå

I once such a task is complete, I'll mostly be deleting a lot of the smaller tasks. For example, I was someone who used to watch a lot of YouTube videos related to social skills and communication, etc. but once I went through therapy, incorporated it's lessons, I no longer needed to watch a lot of those videos. So I deleted them.

‚Äå

Similarly, I remember I had a huge list of "content" to watch. After completely listening to the Bhagwad Gita and incorporating it's lessons, I deleted about 40 cards and tasks. Doing one task well had eliminated 40 cards üÉè and it still does.

‚Äå

Whenever something happens, I think I had learned something to deal with this type of problem, what was it? Then I try to recall. And if I can't recall correctly, I'll go into the card and read my notes. üé∂. And try to implement it in the next few days. #neverGoingBack

‚Äå

More boards

I realized that more boards makes Trello really overwhelming. But by not having more boards, I was really missing out on productivity gains.

- Good planning

- Ultimately getting progress

‚Äå

I figured out there is no other way, I need to create more boards.

‚Äå

The way I did it was much more organic. I experimented with a few boards. And also deleted a few, for example, I realized Job board wasn't super useful for me because 90% of recruiters ghost and rest reply super late after a month or two. ‚è∞ . The cards on my Job Search board would remain stale.

So instead I started tracking only when I had passed the initial screening and was giving online tests.

‚Äå

Initially, I also had writing and all other tasks mixed into one board. This made it very overwhelming.

‚Äå

I started by separating Life and Writing. ‚úçÔ∏è

Then I realized I need something for Development so I created one called DevLife.

These remained my main boards.

‚Äå

Later, I realized I needed ways to improve my health, so I started Body Board.

‚Äå

Then I thought I should also do things in life. I being someone who doesn't go out much. I think It'll be good to get out. Maybe watch shows etc. so I created Experiences board.

‚Äå

Tip is this: anything that is important to you, should be part of trello. If it's small you can keep less number of boards. But as you get more interested, you'll find it's better to split into a separate board.

‚Äå

Note depending on the domain, the speed at which cards move changes.

‚Äå

For example, Travel board tasks will be added over months but will be completed in a week when you actually go to travel. Most of the year you'll spend time planning your travel.

‚Äå

Similarly, Body board will have a lot of goals that take time

‚Äå

Finance Stories usually move faster. Finanial goal achievement is slower over months.

‚Äå

Etc etc. This gives you a satisfaction. You know everything is undercontrol and moving.

‚Äå

Capturing Long Term Goals and Knowledge

‚Äå

There are some fundamental knowledge about any domain that are long term and that you would like to he reminded of.

‚Äå

For this, I have added column with such information.

For example my "Finance Flyway" board has these columns at the right

- Monthly Spending: A card per month for monthly spending

- Money Goals: All my financial goals regarding money.

- Money Formulas: Things like 50:30:20. Rule of 72 etc.

- Money Mindset: Repair over Buy. Protect Electronics. Think of Money as Value.

- Trusted Entities: Companies and People I trust

- Bad Entities: Companies and People I can't trust financially or maybe even personally.

‚Äå

I have more such columns in Finance Flyway. Software Development board also has multiple such columns related to different types of Technology (AWS, Astro, Java, Java Multithreading, etc) Other domains have less.

‚Äå

Making board interesting to use. Images and Dashcards and changing names. #AutoLawOfAttraction

The board should be interesting and fun to use. Else you'll use it less and less. So this is an important step and you won't want to ignore it cuz it sounds cheesy.

‚Äå

There are a few ways to have an interesting board.

‚Äå

You can change the background image to something you like.

‚Äå

You can add images to cards. üé¥. I especially add images to my goal cards. üé¥

‚Äå

Add Dash-cards. Dash-cards is trello power-up that shows you quick count of number of things in a list or based on a certain criteria. I add dash-cards for any list that is significant.

- This week

- In progress

- Done

- Chained Task

- Quality Control

- Each idea column

‚Äå

Also I change the names of columns and boards when I find I am not using it much. For example my finance board had the following names over the months

- Money

- Paisa

- How money works

- Finance

- Financial Flyway (Current)

‚Äå

Changing names gives a new way of looking üëÄ at the board. So I keep updating it iteratively.
